# [WebShop](http://github.com/goldblattster/webshop) - Bukkit shops the way they were meant to be

At my local datacenter, these are rows and rows of servers. Some of them have Minecraft servers. And a lot of these Minecraft servers have ChestShop installed on them. These servers span the world. If you put them end to end, they would probably go around several times.

One day all these servers that have ChestShop on them are going to crush us all.

## Features
- Visually appealing, elegant web interface
- Lightweight plugin that performs minimal economy transactions (less lag)
- Interactive interface is designed for virtual shops. Signs just don't cut it.
- Items are stored using a virtual chest system instead of physical chests
- Easy set-up
- Secure

## Use WebShop if you...
- Use ChestShop and it lags your server whenver a player spams right-click on signs
- Want a sexy alternative
- Have a web server supporting PHP and MySQL
- Like to be able to manage players in-depth
- Want all shops to be in a centralized location
- Want to use a shop system designed for virtual shops, instead of trying to mash shops and in-game blocks together.
- A lot more.

## Don't use WebShop if you...
- Don't have a web server supporting PHP and MySQL
- Only use ChestShop or a ChestShop like plugin for the "Admin Shop" feature (WebShop doesn't have that)
